Release Checklist for pytest_datatest
=====================================

1. Run full set of tox environment tests (not just the shorter subset
   used for most development work).

2. Verify *version* argument in `setup.py`.

3. Verify *version* and *version_info* variables in `pytest_datatest.py`.

4. Add release date to `CHANGELOG` and make sure it includes all notable changes.

5. Commit and push final changes to upstream repository.

6. Make sure the packaging tools are up-to-date:

       pip install -U twine wheel setuptools

7. Remove all existing files in the `dist/` folder.

8. Build new distributions:

       python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

9. Upload source and wheel distributions to PyPI:

       twine upload dist/*

10. Double check PyPI project page and test installation from PyPI.

11. Add a version-tag to the upstream development repository.

12. Bundle this version with the datatest package.

    In the datatest project's development repository, do the following:

    * Copy the contents of `pytest_datatest.py` into the
      `datatest/_pytest_plugin.py` file.
    * Commit this change with a comment like the one below:

	      Update bundled pytest-datatest plugin to version X.X.X.

13. Iterate version number in repository to `X.X.X.dev0` so it is not
    confused with the just-published release. Check the following files:

    * `setup.py`
    * `pytest_datatest.py`

    Commit these changes with a comment like the one below:

        Iterate version number to differentiate development version
        from latest release.
