pytest_datatest Changelog
=========================


YYYY-MM-DD (0.1.2)
==================

* Added handling for a 'mandatory' marker to support incremental testing
  (stops session early when a mandatory test fails).
* Added '--ignore-mandatory' option to continue tests even when a mandatory
  test fails.
* Changed the bundled-version-notice from a *warning* into a report section.
* Added pytest hook to properly deactivate the bundled plugin when using the
  development version.


2018-04-07 (0.1.1)
==================

* First public release.
* Added formal development-version notice (see module docstring and README).
  This plugin is primarily intended for developers while typical users should
  use the copy that is bundled with ``datatest``.

* Added error formatting when pytest runs existing unittest-style tests.


2017-11-25 (0.1.0)
==================

* Initial version for testing (never officially released).
