* Changed handling for 'mandatory' marker to support older and newer Pytest
  versions.


2018-06-21 (0.1.2)
==================

  (stops session early when a mandatory test fails).
* Added '--ignore-mandatory' option to continue tests even when a mandatory
  test fails.
* Changed the bundled-version-notice from a *warning* into a report section.
* Added pytest hook to properly deactivate the bundled plugin when using the
  development version.
