Release Checklist for pytest_datatest
=====================================

1. Run full set of tox environment tests (not just the shorter subset
   used for most development work).

2. Verify *version* argument in setup.py.

3. Verify *version* and *version_info* variables in pytest_datatest.py.

4. Add release date to CHANGELOG and make sure it includes all notable changes.

5. Commit and push final changes to upstream repository.

6. Remove all existing files in the dist/ folder.

7. Build new distributions:

   $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

8. Upload source and wheel distributions to PyPI:

   $ twine upload dist/*

9. Double check PyPI project page and test installation from PyPI.

10. Add a version-tag to the upstream development repository.

11. Bundle this version with the datatest package.

    In the datatest project's development repository, do the following:

        * Copy "pytest_datatest.py" into the "datatest/_pytest_plugin/" folder.

        * Commit this change with a comment like the one below:

            "Update bundled pytest-datatest plugin to version X.X.X."

12. Iterate version number in repository so it is not confused
    with the just-published release. Check the following files:

    * setup.py
    * pytest_datatest.py
